My name is Samuel Audic and I'm 22 years old. I'm passionate about new technologies, computing and the web. My hobbies include travel, cinema, video games and sports.
Since I was a child, I've been lucky enough to visit countries such as Spain, Italy, the Netherlands and the United States. Thanks to these experiences, I've been able to discover new cultures and enrich my foreign language skills.
